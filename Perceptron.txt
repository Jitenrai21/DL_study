Perceptron:
Base neural network.

Single Layer percetron: 
Inputs(X1) -> Weights(W1) -> Summation and bias(âˆ‘(WiXi) + bias) -> Activation -> Outputs,
The weights can be used to manage output.
Summation gives (x1w1 + x2w2 + x3w3 + b), b = bias
Activation: Converts the input in desired output.
Outputs if not as desired changes to bias and weights.
