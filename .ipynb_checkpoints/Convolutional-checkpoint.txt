Convolutional layer:
First stage of image classification. 
In maths, convolution is a mathematical operation on two function that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.
c = (f*g)(t) = âˆ«f(r)g(t-r)dr

c = convolution output function
f = original input function
g = function that is shifted over the input function
t = variable representing range of shifting
r = shifting against t
âˆ« = limit zero to t

In conv layer the imp features or edges are detected 
input data -> kernel -> convoluted feature
