Deep Learning:
It is a subpart of machine learning. 
Used to solve problems in classification and regression of machine learning.
(AI > ML > DL > Neural Network) intersects with data science.

Deep Learning is a collection of statistical techniques of machine learning for learning feature hierarchies that are actually based on artificial neural networks.
ML -> Algorithms(set of formula)
DL -> Neural networks(connections forms networks)

Neuron:
Inputs(X1) -> Weights(W1) -> Summation and bias(∑(WiXi) + bias) -> Activation -> Outputs

Application:
voice commands
Image recognition
Automatic vehicles
Translators

Deep learning:
a. Needs big data.
b. Requires machines with GPU.
c. Needs to understand the basic functionality of the data. While ML understands the features and how they represent the data.
d. May take few hours or weeks to process and comparatively longer training time.
e. Its consists few algorithms.

Neurons:
Data is tranferred to mind through Neurons in Human biology.
Biological neuron : Dendrite(senses on skin) -> Cell nucleus -> Axon -> Synapses(connected to mind)

Inputs(X1) -> Weights(W1) -> Summation and bias(∑(WiXi) + bias) -> Activation -> Outputs

summation gives (x1w1 + x2w2 + x3w3 + b), b = bias
Activation: Converts the input in desired output.

Types of Deep learning:
Perceptron
Feed Forward networks(same as perceptron)
Multi-Layer Perceptron(Artificial Neural Network)
Radial Based Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks(Keyboards words suggestions)
Long Short-Term Memory Networks
